## Project Documentation
This project is a git version project where two different branches are created for 2 people to work on and later merge into the main. Morgan works on one branch that is add-book-reviews while Jamie work on the update-events branch.

I started by adding some html files into the main branch then creating add-book-reviews branch which contain book-review.html the pull request is made by Morgan and it was merged to the main. this goes same with Jamie's branch. 

Thank you.
